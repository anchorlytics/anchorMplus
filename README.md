## An R interface to Mplus: prepare data and input, parse output

Mplus is leading commercial software for structural equation
modelling (SEM).  It is, however, rather particular in its input requirements,
and its output is hard to parse.  It is a command-line program that reads
and writes text files.  This package aims to ease the integration of Mplus
with R, allowing one to leverage R for data munging, graphing, etc., and
invoke Mplus for the SEM fit.
  
This package is heavily inspired by and owes a great debt to
Michael Hallquist's MplusAutomation package.
