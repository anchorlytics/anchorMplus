Package: anchorMplus
Title: R interface to Mplus
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: as.person("Sean Ho <anchor@seanho.com> [aut, cre]")
Description: Mplus is leading commercial software for structural equation
  modelling (SEM).  It is, however, rather particular in its input requirements,
  and its output is hard to parse.  It is a command-line program that reads
  and writes text files.  This package aims to ease the integration of Mplus
  with R, allowing one to leverage R for data munging, graphing, etc., and
  invoke Mplus for the SEM fit.
  This package is heavily inspired by and owes a great debt to
  Michael Hallquist's MplusAutomation package.
